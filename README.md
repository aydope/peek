## Project Structure

```bash
Peek/
├── index.js          # Main server file
├── package.json       # Dependencies and scripts
├── public/           # Default serving directory
│   ├── welcome.txt   # Sample file
│   └── sample.html   # Sample HTML file
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

## Configuration

You can modify these settings in the code:

```js
// Allowed file extensions
#allowedFileTypes = ['.txt', '.js', '.html', '.css', '.json', ...];

// Maximum file size (10MB)
#maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;

// Restricted paths
#restrictedPaths = ['node_modules', '.git', '.env'];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, start the server with a different port:

```bash
node index.js start --port 8080
```

### Cannot Access Files

Ensure files are placed inside the `public` directory (or your specified directory).

### File Type Not Allowed

Only files with allowed extensions can be created. Check the allowed types list.

### Permission Denied

Make sure you have read/write permissions for the serving directory.

### Error: ENOENT

This means the file or directory doesn't exist. Check the path and try again.

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
node index.js cli
```

### Adding New File Types

Edit the `#allowedFileTypes` array in the code:

```js
#allowedFileTypes = ['.txt', '.js', '.html', '.css', '.json', '.md', '.xml', '.jpg', '.png', '.gif', '.svg', '.your-ext'];
```

### Customizing UI

The UI HTML/CSS is generated in the `#generateUI` method. You can modify the styles and layout there.

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)

## Package.json Scripts

```bash
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js start",
    "cli": "node index.js cli",
